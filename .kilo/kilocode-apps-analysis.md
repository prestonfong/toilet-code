- **Pipeline Optimization**: Efficient CI/CD workflows with cache optimization

Key Turbo Tasks:
- `build`: Optimized builds with proper input/output tracking
- `test`: Test execution with dependency on type builds
- `storybook`: Development server with persistence
- `chromatic`: Visual testing with Storybook build dependency
- `playwright`: E2E testing without caching for reliability

### Development Workflows

#### Local Development
```bash
pnpm install          # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev              # Start all development servers
pnpm test             # Run comprehensive test suites
pnpm lint             # Code quality checks
pnpm build            # Production builds
```

#### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Workflows**: Automated testing and deployment

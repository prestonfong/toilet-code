# Kilo Code Web Version - Project Progress Log

## Project Overview
Creating a standalone web version of the Kilo Code VS Code extension that runs at `server:5000` and provides identical functionality to the extension, accessible via web browser.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: VS Code Dependencies Analysis & Abstraction Layer Design
**Completed**: 2025-08-02  
**Mode**: Architect  
**Deliverables**:
- `.kilo/vscode-abstraction-analysis.md` - Complete VS Code dependency analysis
- `.kilo/implementation-roadmap.md` - Detailed 12-week implementation plan

**Key Achievements**:
- **26+ VS Code API integration points** identified and cataloged
- **Critical dependencies** mapped: file system, terminal, webview, configuration, commands
- **Complete abstraction layer architecture** designed with 100% API compatibility
- **Implementation strategy** defined: Node.js/Express + xterm.js + WebSocket hybrid
- **12-week roadmap** created with clear phases and milestones

### ✅ Task 2: Web Server Architecture Design
**Completed**: 2025-08-02  
**Mode**: Architect  
**Deliverables**:
- `.kilo/web-server-architecture.md` - 574-line comprehensive architectural specification

**Key Achievements**:
- **Complete system architecture** with mobile-first design principles
- **Local deployment strategy** for localhost:5000 (single-user, no auth required)
- **File-based JSON storage** maintaining VS Code extension compatibility
- **Mobile-first React frontend** with PWA capabilities and touch optimization
- **Performance targets**: <200KB initial bundle, battery-efficient WebSocket management
- **5-phase implementation roadmap** (9-11 week timeline)

**Innovation**: Revolutionary transformation from desktop-only VS Code extension to mobile-accessible AI coding assistant

## Active Tasks
- [ ] Extract and adapt core ClineProvider functionality for standalone operation

## Pending Tasks
- Implement file system operations and workspace management for server environment
- Port webview message handling system to WebSocket-based communication
- Adapt AI provider integrations to work without VS Code context
- Create web-based file explorer and editor interface
- Implement authentication and security measures for web access
- Port terminal integration using web-based terminal (xterm.js)
- Adapt MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for web environment
- Create development and production deployment configurations
- Test the complete web application with core Kilo Code features

## Key Insights from Task 2
1. **Mobile-First Innovation**: The architecture introduces mobile accessibility to AI coding - a revolutionary advancement
2. **Simplified Deployment**: Local-only deployment with file-based storage eliminates complexity while maintaining full functionality
3. **Performance Optimization**: PWA approach with aggressive bundle size targets ensures excellent mobile performance
4. **Development Ready**: Clear 5-phase implementation plan with actionable steps for development teams

## Technical Stack Finalized
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express + WebSocket server
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Zustand + Tailwind CSS + PWA
- **Communication**: REST API + WebSocket real-time updates
- **Storage**: JSON files (VS Code extension compatible)
- **Mobile Features**: Touch optimization, voice input, gesture navigation, offline functionality

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity Management**: Mobile-first approach simplifies while adding innovative capabilities
- **Feature Parity**: File-based storage ensures 100% compatibility with existing VS Code extension data
- **Performance Planning**: Aggressive optimization targets prevent mobile performance issues
- **Development Clarity**: Detailed 5-phase plan prevents scope creep and ensures systematic progress
